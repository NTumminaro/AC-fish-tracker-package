# Animal Crossing Fish Tracker Pack for Emotracker

This is a simple fish tracker pack for Emotracker! 

For now, it only supports the fish available in Animal Crossing for Gamecube. However, I plan to add layouts for each Animal Crossing game's available fish, and possibly bugs.

EmoTracker can be found [here](https://emotracker.net).

## Installation

Download the lastest build from[Github](https://github.com/NTumminaro/AC-fish-tracker-package) and place it in your packs folder unzipped (still in the AC_fish_tracker_package folder).

The packs folder for Emotracker can be found under `USER/Documents/EmoTracker/packs`.

## Customization

Overides can be made in the emotracker application, and applied to the pack. However, the source code itself found in this pack's folder can be edited manually as well!

## Questions or Suggestions

If you have any questions or comments regarding this pack, feel free to reach out to me on discord, or submit an issue on the repo if you have any issues!
